Basic Servertest:
Simple multithreaded server test for a client that can ask for a „Date“ or „Time“ and gets the answer from the server. 
This test was written before we connected the server/client architecture with the code of the model and view. 
It was written only to test the  rudimentary function of the clients connecting to the server and exchange of information in between. 
With the knowledge of this function working, we could go on and implement the parsers, etc. and finish the code to the final state you see now. 
Output terminal server – every 5sec it prints out „5 sec“ and which threads are connected:
